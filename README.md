# Client-side prediction and server reconciliation
(Derived from Joe Best-Rotheray's project, https://github.com/spectre1989/unity_physics_csp)

This is the base project for the first assignment. In this exercise, you'll implement client-side prediction and server reconciliation. Optionally, you'll implement deterministic lockstep as well.
